> :warning: **Please attention**: as you can see this work is publicly available and anyone is obviously free of taking ideas from that. Anyway if it will be found that someone is copying the code (in the mean CTRL-C / CTRL-V) for its own project of the *same* exam, they will be reported to the Professor.
